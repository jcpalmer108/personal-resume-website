# Background

Back in 2018, when I first moved to the West Coast, I was informed by a recruiter I was working with that having a Resume Website on-hand and live could be a crucial piece to my job-hunt journey in that new world.

While heeding her advice, I discovered that I had no free time to dedicate building a website front-to-back so I ended up whipping up a quick web page in the popular CMS, Squarespace. This website served its purpose for what I needed at the time, however I have been looking to replace it with something custom since first going-live on my domain "www.jennapalmer.info".

That is where this project steps in. I'm creating this project utilizing much of what I've learned over these last 5 years, working as a Full-Stack Software Engineer on several high-profile clients. I hope that upon its completion, this website will be a shining example of what I am personally capable of, and how I would go about solving complicated problems with well-rounded solutions.

# Feature List

This project features the following features:

<a name="responsive-navbar"></a>

## Mobile & Desktop Friendly Navbar

Renders as a hamburger menu on mobile, and when expanded wide enough, removes the hamburger and displays a list of available menu pages.

![Desktop & Mobile Friendly Navbar](./src/assets/images/readme/navbar-example.png)

<a name="calls-to-action"></a>

## Multiple Calls to Action

There are several buttons throughout the website that link to the 'Contact' section in order to streamline getting the user in contact with the author.

![Multiple Calls to Action](./src/assets/images/readme/calls-to-action.png)

<a name="marquee"></a>

## Marquee to Mosaic

The mobile version of the Skills Section shows several of the skills tiles rotating on a marquee. The desktop version completely removes this marquee, and instead renders a mosaic of tiles that stay squares when resizing the page width.

![Marquee to Mosaic](./src/assets/images/readme/marquee-to-mosaic.gif)

<a name="carosel"></a>

## Rotating Testimonial Carousel

The Testimonial page has a carosel of testimonials that automatically scrolls through each of the available quotes every 10 seconds.

<a name="dynamically-created-components"></a>

## Dynamically Created Components

Several sections illustrate the utilization of dynamically rendered components, however the Work History section is the bext example of them all. All job history is stored in an array of objects, and this array is used to dynamically create each job listing.

This means, that the modals created for each Job are also dynamically rendered.

![Dynamically Created Components](./src/assets/images/readme/dynamic-components.png)

<a name="modal"></a>

## Modal for Further Information

Users who want more information on a specific piece of job history, can click on the trigger "READ MORE" and see a modal filled with extended information surrounding the author's participation in that role.

![Modal for Further Information](./src/assets/images/readme/modals-example.gif)

<a name="email-on-submit"></a>

## Email Opens Drafted Email

In the Contact section there is a form, and this form actively sends the author an email with the added information.

<a name="futurefeatures"></a>

# Future Features

These are features that may be developed one day, but are not currently under development:

## Database and API for Content

I would like to create an online database that I am able to automatically update with any updates, changes, or removals from my resume information. I would like my website to pull its data from this database, so that upon a successful API call the website is updated accordingly.

## Resume Generator (for Personal Use)

Given that I have all of my website content provided on a single file, I would love to create a terminal form that allows me to custom generate a Resume given varying requirements. This would assist me during future interviews because it would allow me to possibly cater my resume to fit what the team needs at that time. (This could also be a cover letter generator!)

## Resume Generator (for Website)

If I already have the logic to generate a resume, might as well add a "Download my Resume HERE" button to the website. This would download the most generic version of my resume.
